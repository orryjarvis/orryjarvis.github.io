# Welcome!

You have stumbled upon my little nook. I intend for this website to not only be both a place to share my thoughts and things I've learnedâ€” but also a place for me to experiment with gatsby, react, etc. If anything is broken or wonky, please let me know on [github](https://github.com/orryjarvis/orryjarvis.github.io/issues). Opinions here are my own.
